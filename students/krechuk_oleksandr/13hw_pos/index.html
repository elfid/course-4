                        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                            React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to
                            access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI
                            using React components: <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You
                            can learn more about React
                            in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                        <p>React Native runs on <ins>React</ins>, a popular open source library for building user
                            interfaces with
                            JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This
                            section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                                <p><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React
                                    uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a
                                    cafe to work in.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p> <strong>+ JSX.</strong>
                                    React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
                                    inside JavaScript like so: <mark> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt; &frasl;
                                        Text&gt;.</mark>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The React docs have <ins> a comprehensive guide to JSX</ins> you can refer to learn
                                    even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                                    declaring a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces
                                    inside <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>+ state.</strong> For example, let's say that as the user types, you're
                                    translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every
                                    single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                                    "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>

                            that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
                            that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
